                            for instructor status in your profile settings. 
                            We'll ask for some additional information to ensure you meet our instructor criteria,
                            and you'll hear back from us within 3-5 business days.

                            and expect it to be available by the end of the year. Stay tuned for updates
                            and announcements in our newsletters and on our homepage.

                            Enrolling in a course is simple. Once you've found a course you're interested in,
                            click on the 'Enroll' button on the course page. If you're not already logged in,
                            you'll be prompted to do so.
